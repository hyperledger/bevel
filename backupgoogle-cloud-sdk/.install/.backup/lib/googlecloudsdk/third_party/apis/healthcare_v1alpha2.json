Different\nversions of the same resource are distinguishable by the meta.versionId\nand meta.lastUpdated columns. The operation (CREATE\/UPDATE\/DELETE) that\nresults in the new version is recorded in the meta.tag.\n\nThe tables contain all historical resource versions since streaming was\nenabled. For query convenience, the server also creates one view per\ntable of the same name containing only the current resource version.\n\nThe streamed data in the BigQuery dataset is not guaranteed to be\ncompletely unique. The combination of the id and meta.versionId columns\nshould ideally identify a single unique row. But in rare cases,\nduplicates may exist. At query time, users may use the SQL select\nstatement to keep only one of the duplicate rows given an id and\nmeta.versionId pair. Alternatively, the server created view mentioned\nabove also filters out duplicates.\n\nBefore adding this configuration, you must add the\n[`bigquery.dataEditor`](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/bigquery\/docs\/access-control#bigquery.dataEditor)\nrole to your project's **Cloud Healthcare Service Agent**\n[service account](https:\/\/cloud.google.com\/iam\/docs\/service-accounts).\n\nIf a resource mutation cannot be streamed to BigQuery, errors will be\nlogged to Cloud Logging\n (see [Viewing logs](\/healthcare\/docs\/how-tos\/logging)).",

This method is optimized to load large quantities of data using\nimport semantics that ignore some HL7v2 store configuration options and are\nnot suitable for all use cases. It is primarily intended to load data into\nan empty HL7v2 store that is not being used by other clients.\n\nAn existing message will be overwritten if a duplicate message is imported.\nA duplicate message is a message with the same raw bytes as a message that\nalready exists in this HL7v2 store. When a message is overwritten, its\nlabels will also be overwritten.\n\nThe import operation is idempotent unless the input data contains multiple\nvalid messages with the same raw bytes but different labels. In that case,\nafter the import completes, the store contains exactly one message\nwith those raw bytes but there is no ordering guarantee on which version\nof the labels it has. The operation result counters do not count\nduplicated raw bytes as an error and count one success for each message in\nthe input, which might result in a success count larger than the number\nof messages in the HL7v2 store.\n\nIf some messages fail to import, for example due to parsing errors,\nsuccessfully imported messages are not rolled back.\n\nThis method returns an Operation that can\nbe used to track the status of the import by calling\nGetOperation.\n\nImmediate fatal errors appear in the\nerror field, errors are also logged\nto Cloud Logging (see [Viewing\nlogs](\/healthcare\/docs\/how-tos\/logging)).

                      "description": "Import resources to the FHIR store by loading data from the specified\nsources. This method is optimized to load large quantities of data using\nimport semantics that ignore some FHIR store configuration options and are\nnot suitable for all use cases. It is primarily intended to load data into\nan empty FHIR store that is not being used by other clients. In cases\nwhere this method is not appropriate, consider using ExecuteBundle to\nload data.\n\nEvery resource in the input must contain a client-supplied ID. Each\nresource is stored using the supplied ID regardless of the\nenable_update_create setting on the FHIR\nstore.\n\nThe import process does not enforce referential integrity, regardless of\nthe\ndisable_referential_integrity\nsetting on the FHIR store. This allows the import of resources with\narbitrary interdependencies without considering grouping or ordering, but\nif the input data contains invalid references or if some resources fail to\nbe imported, the FHIR store might be left in a state that violates\nreferential integrity.\n\nThe import process does not trigger Cloud Pub\/Sub notification or BigQuery\nstreaming update, regardless of how those are configured on the FHIR store.\n\nIf a resource with the specified ID already exists, the most recent\nversion of the resource is overwritten without creating a new historical\nversion, regardless of the\ndisable_resource_versioning\nsetting on the FHIR store. If transient failures occur during the import,\nsuccessfully imported resources could be overwritten more than once.\n\nThe import operation is idempotent unless the input data contains multiple\nvalid resources with the same ID but different contents. In that case,\nafter the import completes, the store contains exactly one resource\nwith that ID but there is no ordering guarantee on which version of the\ncontents it has. The operation result counters do not count\nduplicate IDs as an error and count one success for each resource in\nthe input, which might result in a success count larger than the number\nof resources in the FHIR store. This often occurs when importing data\norganized in bundles produced by Patient-everything\nwhere each bundle contains its own copy of a resource such as Practitioner\nthat might be referred to by many patients.\n\nIf some resources fail to import, for example due to parsing errors,\nsuccessfully imported resources are not rolled back.\n\nThe location and format of the input data is specified by the parameters\nbelow. Note that if no format is specified, this method assumes the\n`BUNDLE` format. When using the `BUNDLE` format this method ignores the\n`Bundle.type` field, except that `history` bundles are rejected, and does\nnot apply any of the bundle processing semantics for batch or transaction\nbundles. Unlike in ExecuteBundle, transaction bundles are not executed\nas a single transaction and bundle-internal references are not rewritten.\nThe bundle is treated as a collection of resources to be written as\nprovided in `Bundle.entry.resource`, ignoring `Bundle.entry.request`. As\nan example, this allows the import of `searchset` bundles produced by a\nFHIR search or\nPatient-everything operation.\n\nThis method returns an Operation that can\nbe used to track the status of the import by calling\nGetOperation.\n\nImmediate fatal errors appear in the\nerror field, errors are also logged\nto Cloud Logging (see [Viewing\nlogs](\/healthcare\/docs\/how-tos\/logging)). Otherwise, when the\noperation finishes, a detailed response of type ImportResourcesResponse\nis returned in the response field.\nThe metadata field type for this\noperation is OperationMetadata."
