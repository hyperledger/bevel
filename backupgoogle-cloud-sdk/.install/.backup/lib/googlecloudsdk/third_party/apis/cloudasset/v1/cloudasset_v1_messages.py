class Asset(_messages.Message):
  r"""An asset in Google Cloud. An asset can be any resource in the Google
  Cloud [resource hierarchy](https://cloud.google.com/resource-
  manager/docs/cloud-platform-resource-hierarchy), a resource outside the
  Google Cloud resource hierarchy (such as Google Kubernetes Engine clusters
  and objects), or a policy (e.g. Cloud IAM policy). See [Supported asset
  types](https://cloud.google.com/asset-inventory/docs/supported-asset-types)
  for more information.

  Fields:
    accessLevel: Please also refer to the [access level user
      guide](https://cloud.google.com/access-context-
      manager/docs/overview#access-levels).
    accessPolicy: Please also refer to the [access policy user
      guide](https://cloud.google.com/access-context-
      manager/docs/overview#access-policies).
    ancestors: The ancestry path of an asset in Google Cloud [resource
      hierarchy](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/cloud-
      platform-resource-hierarchy), represented as a list of relative resource
      names. An ancestry path starts with the closest ancestor in the
      hierarchy and ends at root. If the asset is a project, folder, or
      organization, the ancestry path starts from the asset itself.  Example:
      `["projects/123456789", "folders/5432", "organizations/1234"]`
    assetType: The type of the asset. Example: `compute.googleapis.com/Disk`
      See [Supported asset types](https://cloud.google.com/asset-
      inventory/docs/supported-asset-types) for more information.
    iamPolicy: A representation of the Cloud IAM policy set on a Google Cloud
      resource. There can be a maximum of one Cloud IAM policy set on any
      given resource. In addition, Cloud IAM policies inherit their granted
      access scope from any policies set on parent resources in the resource
      hierarchy. Therefore, the effectively policy is the union of both the
      policy set on this resource and each policy set on all of the resource's
      ancestry resource levels in the hierarchy. See [this
      topic](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/policies#inheritance) for more
      information.
    name: The full name of the asset. Example: `//compute.googleapis.com/proje
      cts/my_project_123/zones/zone1/instances/instance1`  See [Resource names
      ](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/resource_names#full_resource_name
      ) for more information.
    orgPolicy: A representation of an [organization
      policy](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-
      policy/overview#organization_policy). There can be more than one
      organization policy with different constraints set on a given resource.
    resource: A representation of the resource.
    servicePerimeter: Please also refer to the [service perimeter user
      guide](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/docs/overview).
    updateTime: The last update timestamp of an asset. update_time is updated
      when create/update/delete operation is performed.

      `constraints/compute.disableSerialPortAccess` with `constraint_default`
      set to `ALLOW`. A `Policy` for that `Constraint` exhibits the following
      behavior:   - If the `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to
      `false`, serial     port connection attempts will be allowed.   - If the
      `Policy` at this resource has enforced set to `true`, serial     port

      the`Policy` were set at     this resource.  The following examples
      demonstrate the different possible layerings:  Example 1 (nearest
      `Constraint` wins):   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with:
      {enforced: false}   `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The constraint
      at `projects/bar` and `organizations/foo` will not be enforced.  Example
      2 (enforcement gets replaced):   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy`
      with:     {enforced: false}   `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
      {enforced: true} The constraint at `organizations/foo` is not enforced.

class GoogleCloudOrgpolicyV1ListPolicy(_messages.Message):
  r"""Used in `policy_type` to specify how `list_policy` behaves at this
  resource.  `ListPolicy` can define specific values and subtrees of Cloud
  Resource Manager resource hierarchy (`Organizations`, `Folders`, `Projects`)
  that are allowed or denied by setting the `allowed_values` and
  `denied_values` fields. This is achieved by using the `under:` and optional
  `is:` prefixes. The `under:` prefix is used to denote resource subtree
  values. The `is:` prefix is used to denote specific values, and is required
  only if the value contains a ":". Values prefixed with "is:" are treated the
  same as values with no prefix. Ancestry subtrees must be in one of the
  following formats:     - "projects/<project-id>", e.g. "projects/tokyo-
  rain-123"     - "folders/<folder-id>", e.g. "folders/1234"     -
  "organizations/<organization-id>", e.g. "organizations/1234" The
  `supports_under` field of the associated `Constraint`  defines whether
  ancestry prefixes can be used. You can set `allowed_values` and
  `denied_values` in the same `Policy` if `all_values` is
  `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`. `ALLOW` or `DENY` are used to allow or deny all
  values. If `all_values` is set to either `ALLOW` or `DENY`, `allowed_values`
  and `denied_values` must be unset.

  Enums:
    AllValuesValueValuesEnum: The policy all_values state.

  Fields:
    allValues: The policy all_values state.
    allowedValues: List of values allowed  at this resource. Can only be set
      if `all_values` is set to `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`.
    deniedValues: List of values denied at this resource. Can only be set if
      `all_values` is set to `ALL_VALUES_UNSPECIFIED`.
    inheritFromParent: Determines the inheritance behavior for this `Policy`.
      By default, a `ListPolicy` set at a resource supersedes any `Policy` set
      anywhere up the resource hierarchy. However, if `inherit_from_parent` is
      set to `true`, then the values from the effective `Policy` of the parent
      resource are inherited, meaning the values set in this `Policy` are
      added to the values inherited up the hierarchy.  Setting `Policy`
      hierarchies that inherit both allowed values and denied values isn't
      recommended in most circumstances to keep the configuration simple and
      understandable. However, it is possible to set a `Policy` with
      `allowed_values` set that inherits a `Policy` with `denied_values` set.
      In this case, the values that are allowed must be in `allowed_values`
      and not present in `denied_values`.  For example, suppose you have a
      `Constraint` `constraints/serviceuser.services`, which has a
      `constraint_type` of `list_constraint`, and with `constraint_default`
      set to `ALLOW`. Suppose that at the Organization level, a `Policy` is
      applied that restricts the allowed API activations to {`E1`, `E2`}.
      Then, if a `Policy` is applied to a project below the Organization that
      has `inherit_from_parent` set to `false` and field all_values set to
      DENY, then an attempt to activate any API will be denied.  The following
      examples demonstrate different possible layerings for `projects/bar`
      parented by `organizations/foo`:  Example 1 (no inherited values):
      `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:     {allowed_values:
      "E1" allowed_values:"E2"}   `projects/bar` has `inherit_from_parent`
      `false` and values:     {allowed_values: "E3" allowed_values: "E4"} The
      accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted
      values at `projects/bar` are `E3`, and `E4`.  Example 2 (inherited
      values):   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
      {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values:"E2"}   `projects/bar` has a
      `Policy` with values:     {value: "E3" value: "E4" inherit_from_parent:
      true} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The
      accepted values at `projects/bar` are `E1`, `E2`, `E3`, and `E4`.
      Example 3 (inheriting both allowed and denied values):
      `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:     {allowed_values:
      "E1" allowed_values: "E2"}   `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
      {denied_values: "E1"} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are
      `E1`, `E2`. The value accepted at `projects/bar` is `E2`.  Example 4
      (RestoreDefault):   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:
      {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values:"E2"}   `projects/bar` has a
      `Policy` with values:     {RestoreDefault: {}} The accepted values at
      `organizations/foo` are `E1`, `E2`. The accepted values at
      `projects/bar` are either all or none depending on the value of
      `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none).  Example 5 (no
      policy inherits parent policy):   `organizations/foo` has no `Policy`
      set.   `projects/bar` has no `Policy` set. The accepted values at both
      levels are either all or none depending on the value of
      `constraint_default` (if `ALLOW`, all; if `DENY`, none).  Example 6
      (ListConstraint allowing all):   `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with
      values:     {allowed_values: "E1" allowed_values: "E2"}   `projects/bar`
      has a `Policy` with:     {all: ALLOW} The accepted values at
      `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. Any value is accepted at
      `projects/bar`.  Example 7 (ListConstraint allowing none):
      `organizations/foo` has a `Policy` with values:     {allowed_values:
      "E1" allowed_values: "E2"}   `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
      {all: DENY} The accepted values at `organizations/foo` are `E1`, E2`. No
      value is accepted at `projects/bar`.  Example 10 (allowed and denied
      subtrees of Resource Manager hierarchy): Given the following resource
      hierarchy   O1->{F1, F2}; F1->{P1}; F2->{P2, P3},   `organizations/foo`
      has a `Policy` with values:     {allowed_values:
      "under:organizations/O1"}   `projects/bar` has a `Policy` with:
      {allowed_values: "under:projects/P3"}     {denied_values:

  Fields:
    auditConfigs: Specifies cloud audit logging configuration for this policy.
    bindings: Associates a list of `members` to a `role`. Optionally, may
      specify a `condition` that determines how and when the `bindings` are
      applied. Each of the `bindings` must contain at least one member.
    etag: `etag` is used for optimistic concurrency control as a way to help
      prevent simultaneous updates of a policy from overwriting each other. It
      is strongly suggested that systems make use of the `etag` in the read-
      modify-write cycle to perform policy updates in order to avoid race
      conditions: An `etag` is returned in the response to `getIamPolicy`, and
      systems are expected to put that etag in the request to `setIamPolicy`
      to ensure that their change will be applied to the same version of the
      policy.  **Important:** If you use IAM Conditions, you must include the
      `etag` field whenever you call `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field,
      then IAM allows you to overwrite a version `3` policy with a version `1`
      policy, and all of the conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.
    version: Specifies the format of the policy.  Valid values are `0`, `1`,
      and `3`. Requests that specify an invalid value are rejected.  Any
      operation that affects conditional role bindings must specify version
      `3`. This requirement applies to the following operations:  * Getting a
      policy that includes a conditional role binding * Adding a conditional
      role binding to a policy * Changing a conditional role binding in a
      policy * Removing any role binding, with or without a condition, from a
      policy   that includes conditions  **Important:** If you use IAM
      Conditions, you must include the `etag` field whenever you call
      `setIamPolicy`. If you omit this field, then IAM allows you to overwrite
      a version `3` policy with a version `1` policy, and all of the
      conditions in the version `3` policy are lost.  If a policy does not
      include any conditions, operations on that policy may specify any valid
      version or leave the field unset.  To learn which resources support
      conditions in their IAM policies, see the [IAM
      documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/help/conditions/resource-
      policies).
