# Network Configuration File for HyperLedger-Indy Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) Platform

## Overview
# This configuration file is intended for deploying a HyperLedger-Indy platform. 
# The deployment must adhere to the following network rules:
# - Exactly 1 trustee is required per organization.
# - Up to 1 endorser is allowed per organization.
# - At least 4 stewards are required collectively across the entire Indy network.

## Sample Configuration
# This sample configuration file demonstrates a HyperLedger-Indy network with four organizations:
# - Organization 1: Contains only the Trustee.
# - Organization 2: Contains one Trustee, two Stewards, and one Endorser.
# - Organization 3: Contains one Trustee, two Stewards, and one Endorser.
# - Organization 4: Contains one Trustee and one Endorser.

## Customization
# We can customize this configuration to include any number of organizations. 
# However, it is imperative to comply with the network rules mentioned in the Overview section.
