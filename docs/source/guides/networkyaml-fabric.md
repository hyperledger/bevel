# Configuration file specification: Hyperledger-Fabric
A network.yaml file is the base configuration file designed in Hyperledger Bevel for setting up a Fabric DLT network. This file contains all the information related to the infrastructure and network specifications. 


??? note "Schema Definition"

    A json-schema definition is provided in `platforms/network-schema.json` to assist with semantic validations and lints. You can use your favorite yaml lint plugin compatible with json-schema specification, like `redhat.vscode-yaml` for VSCode. You need to adjust the directive in template located in the first line based on your actual build directory:

    `# yaml-language-server: $schema=../platforms/network-schema.json`

The configurations are grouped in the following sections for better understanding.

* [type](#type)

* [version](#version)

* [frontend](#frontend)

* [env](#env)

* [frontend](#frontend)

* [docker](#docker)

* [consensus](#consensus)

* [orderers](#orderers)

* [channels](#channels)

* [organizations](#organizations)


Before setting up a Fabric DLT/Blockchain network, this file needs to be updated with the required specifications.

Use this [sample configuration file](https://github.com/hyperledger/bevel/blob/main/platforms/hyperledger-fabric/configuration/samples/network-fabricv2.yaml) as a base. 

```yaml
--8<-- "platforms/hyperledger-fabric/configuration/samples/network-fabricv2.yaml:7:14"
```

<a name="type"></a>
type
: `type` defines the platform choice like corda/fabric/quorum, here in the example it's **Fabric**.

<a name="version"></a>
version
: `version` defines the version of platform being used. The current Fabric version support is 1.4.8, 2.2.2 & 2.5.4

<a name="frontend"></a>
frontend
: `frontend` s a flag which defines if frontend is enabled for nodes or not. Its value can only be enabled/disabled. This is only applicable if the sample Supplychain App is being installed.

<a name="env"></a>
env
: `env` section contains the environment type. Value for proxy field under this section can be 'none' or 'haproxy'

The snapshot of the `env` section with example value is below

```yaml
--8<-- "platforms/hyperledger-fabric/configuration/samples/network-fabricv2.yaml:19:28"
```
The fields under `env` section are 

| Field      | Description                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------------|
| type       | Environment type. Can be like dev/test/prod.|
| proxy      | Choice of the Cluster Ingress controller. Currently supports 'haproxy' for production/inter-cluster and 'none' for single cluster |
| retry_count       | Retry count for the checks. |
|external_dns       | If the cluster has the external DNS service, this has to be set `enabled` so that the hosted zone is automatically updated. |
|labels| Use this to pass additional labels to the `service`, `deployment` and `pvc` elements of Kubernetes|


<a name="docker"></a>
docker
: `docker` section contains the credentials of the container registry where all the required images are stored.

The snapshot of the `docker` section with example values is below

```yaml
--8<-- "platforms/hyperledger-fabric/configuration/samples/network-fabricv2.yaml:34:40"
```

The fields under `docker` section are

| Field    | Description                            |
|----------|----------------------------------------|
| url      | Docker registry url                    |
| username | Username credential required for login |

The organization with orderer type will have consensus service. The snapshot of consensus service with example values is below

```yaml
--8<-- "platforms/hyperledger-fabric/configuration/samples/network-fabricv2.yaml:227:228"
```

The fields under `consensus` service are

| Field       | Description                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|

| type                      | Only for `kafka`. Consensus service type, only value supported is `broker` currently  |
| replicas                  | Only for `kafka`. Replica count of the brokers  |
| grpc.port                 | Only for `kafka`. Grpc port of consensus service |
