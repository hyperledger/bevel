# **Helm**

Essentially, [Helm](https://helm.sh/) is a package manager for K8s. Helm Charts are configuration files designed for K8s to help define, install and upgrade complex K8s applications.

Helm brings below features:
1. Predictable deployments.
2. Maintains "Bill of Materials" of all the pods that work together to deliver the application.
3. Keeps (forces) a team to stay synchronised.
4. Strong version control.
5. Easier testing and QA.
6. Rollbacks on an application level, not just an one-off pod level.

The Blockchain Automation Framework uses Helm Charts for designing and configuring the architecture of each DLT/Blockchain platform for its own network set-up.
